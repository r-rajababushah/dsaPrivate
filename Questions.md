# Data Structures and Searching Programs in C

This document contains implementations of common searching techniques and linked list operations in C.

---

## 1. Linear Search in an Array
## 7/08/25
```c
// write a program to perform a linear search in a given array in C
```

---

## 2. Binary Search in an Array
## 8/08/25
```c
// write a program to perform binary search in an array
```

---

## 3. Singly Linked List Operations
## 14/08/25
```c
// write a program to create a linked list and perform following operations:
// 1. traversal
// 2. insert a node at the beginning
// 3. insert a node after a given node
// 4. insert a node after the specific position
// 5. insert a node at the end of the list
```

---

## 4. Doubly Linked List - Insert at Beginning
## 18/09/25
```c
// write a program in doubly linked list for inserting a node at beginning
```

---

## 5. Doubly Linked List - Insert at End
## 19/09/25
```c
// write a program in doubly linked list for insertion of node at the end
```

---

## 6. Doubly Linked List - Deletion at Beginning
## 25/09/25
```c
// write a program of deletion at the beginning from doubly linked list
```
